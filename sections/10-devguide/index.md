# Developer Guide

Cavapp is a completely open-source project, and as such, we are delighted to receive contributions from any developers who wish to participate in its development. To modify or add code to the current codebase, the following steps are necessary:

- Fork the project on GitHub
- Add/modify the desired code
- Add/modify tests relevant to the changes made
- Pay attention to using the semantics of conventional commits
- Submit a pull request documenting the changes made, the choices, and the motivations behind them

Once this is done, the continuous integration process will automatically check that the changes conform to the conventions we have adopted for this project, that the tests are present and do not fail. Then, if everything is successful, the pull request will be accepted, resulting in the release of a new version of the software.
