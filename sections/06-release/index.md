# Release

The project release is automatically generated by the CI (as described in the corresponding section). Once the release is generated, it is published on GitHub. Specifically, the release will contain three executable packages for the backend and the two frontends


## Choice of the license

The chosen license is [MIT](https://opensource.org/). This choice stems from the fact that this is an academic project that we want to be open and usable by anyone.

## Choice of the versioning schema

Software versioning refers to the process of assigning a unique identifier to a software state. The identifier is typically an alphanumeric sequence of characters separated by dots, slashes, or dashes.

In our case, to distinguish different versions of the software, we decided to follow the guidelines proposed by [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). Consequently, the software version is represented by three numbers separated by a dot: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH.

The correct version to be associated with the software state is based on the saved commits, which were written following the Conventional Commit approach. In particular, we used the following approach:

**MAJOR** release
* Any commit type and scope terminating with `!` causes a `BREAKING CHANGE`

**MINOR** release
* Commit type `chore` with scope `api-deps` (*Dependency updates*)
* Commit type `feat` (*Features*) with any scope

**PATCH** release
* Commit type `chore` with scope `core-deps` (*Dependency updates*)
* Commit type `fix` (*Bug Fixes*) with any scope
* Commit type `docs` (*Documentation*) with any scope
* Commit type `perf` (*Performance improvements*) with any scope
* Commit type `revert` (*Revert previous changes*) with any scope

No release
* Commit type `test` (*Tests*)
* Commit type `ci` (*Build and continuous integration*)
* Commit type `build` (*Build and continuous integration*)
* Commit type `chore` with scope `deps` (*Dependency updates*)
* Commit type `chore` (*General maintenance*) with scopes different than the ones mentioned above 
* Commit type `style` (*Style improvements*) with any scope 
* Commit type `refactor` (*Refactoring*) with any scope
