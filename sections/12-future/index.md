In terms of future work, several directions could be explored to enhance the functionality and user experience of CavApp. 
One area of focus could be implementing end-to-end encryption for secure communication between users, ensuring privacy and data protection. 
Additionally, integrating multimedia features such as voice calling or video calling could enrich the user experience and make the application more versatile. 
Another aspect to consider is optimizing the application for scalability to accommodate a larger user base.
Furthermore, incorporating real-time synchronization across devices to ensure seamless messaging experiences between the web-based frontend and mobile app frontend could be a valuable improvement. 
Lastly, continuous refinement of the user interface and user experience based on feedback and usability testing would contribute to the overall success and adoption of the application.
